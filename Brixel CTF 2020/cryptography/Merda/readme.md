Brixel CTF 2020

> An Italian messenger was caught during the war
>
>He was carrying a piece of paper that read: ymj kqfl nx gwncjqHYK{uneefsfutqn}
>
>Upon torturing the messenger for an explaination, he gestured a V with his fingers. The english guard took it as an insult and killed him right on the spot.
>
>Maybe he just wanted some peace?

I immediately assumed Merda was shit in Italian. As it is Italian, I thought about roman Caesar cipher.
