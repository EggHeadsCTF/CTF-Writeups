This was a invite only event done by Kennesaw State University in Georgia. The-Enforcers and I got invited to participate in the event hosted by Dr. Andy Green, a professor at KSU for Infosec. The-Enforcers ended first place in the last second while I tied for second with another player. I ended third due to starting late. 

# Crypto 1

This challenge involves a caesar cipher. I immediately know my goto place for normal ciphers. Using a website called [cryptii](https://cryptii.com/) and shifting the message to 13, we can get this flag.

# Crypto 2

> Another operative of ours passed us this information. It seems like an old code, but we canâ€™t make it out. Maybe you can tell us what the answer is?

Its an audio file, after listening to it however, we can hear it is a morse code message. I use a website called [morsecode](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) and playing the file, we can get this flag.

Upon sight it is a pigpen. I use a website called [crypto corner](https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/pigpen-cipher.html) and writing the symbols down, we can get this flag.

# Crypto 4

> You only have one shot with this one, better make it count. We have an operative that just passed us the following message. Which numbered person from the photo is our operative?

Only one person was able to solve this challenge

# Crypto 5

> Another operative just passed us this message to break. Can you crack it and tell us what the answer is?

The-Enforcers was able to solve this. After doing some research he was able to deduce this was a keyboard type prevalent on stenotype keyboards. For those who do not know, this is a keyboard used in court for the reporters to have ease in writing. This is to make their job easy by having common syllables and sounds instead of a whole keyboard. 

This is the flag.
